    "\n",
    "* Expressiveness: Custom exceptions allow you to provide more meaningful and expressive error messages, making it easier to understand the nature of the error and how to handle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Modularity: By creating custom exceptions, you can encapsulate error-handling logic specific to your application or module, promoting modularity and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clarity: Custom exceptions make the code more readable by clearly defining and documenting the types of errors that can occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Granular Control: Custom exceptions allow you to have granular control over how different types of errors are handled. This can be particularly useful when different error conditions require different recovery or reporting mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, custom exceptions in Python provide a way to handle specific error conditions in a more organized and expressive manner, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code."
